# Hi, I am Oliver 👋

I am a software developer and architect located near Cologne, Germany. I love to work agile and adhere to lean principles. I am a father of two, a boardgame geek and I try to run every morning.

I work as Director Cloud & Mobile Software at [Testo](https://www.testo.com/). In my past I have been working in smaller and bigger organizations. I have created and shaped a scaled software development department, where teams love to work and are striving for excellence. I consult StartUp companies in technology, strategy and business.

These are my private repositories and all my projects are free to fork & use. However, there is only an infrequent update to these repositories.

## Contact me 📞

The easiest way to contact me is to follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/-oschwarz/). You can also friend me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oliverschwarz). I regularly post articles over on [my website](https://oliverschwarz.info). If you want to run with me, join me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2824811).
